## Welcome to the ReadMe file for the project titled, "Import and anlyze data."

A UNICEF excel file was downloaded from October of 2014 with countries, genders, urban/rural residence, wealth quintiles, etc.
The data was cleaned and arranged.
Queries were performed to find rates of child labor, girls working, etc.
A rather disheartening exercise of the exploitation of children across the world.
